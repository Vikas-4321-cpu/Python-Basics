What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","   >> Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability with its clean and easy-to-understand syntax, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers.\n","  Python is popular due to several reasons-\n","  - easy to learn and read\n","  -versatile and general purpose\n","  -large community support\n","  -rich labraries and framework\n","  -cross platform compatibility.\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","   >> An interpreter in Python is a program that executes Python code line by line instead of compiling it all at once like a compiler. This allows for quick testing and debugging, making Python highly interactive and beginner-friendly.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","   >> Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.).\n","Examples of keywords include if, else, while, for, def, class, import, try, except, return, True, False, None, etc.\n","Keywords are case-sensitive and cannot be redefined or overridden within a Python program.\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","   >>No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n","\n","   Why?\n","   Keywords are reserved words that have special meanings in Python. Using them as variable names would cause syntax errors because Python wouldn't know whether you're referring to a variable or a built-in function/statement.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n","   >>n Python, objects can be either changeable (modifiable) or unchangeable (unchangeable).\n","   Mutable objects, such as lists and dictionaries, can be modified after creation, while immutable objects, such as tuples and strings, cannot.\n","   Mutability affects how objects are stored and manipulated in memory, impacting performance, memory usage, and concurrency in Python programs.\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","   >>Mutability & Immutability Explained\n","   Mutable objects can be changed after creation.\n","   Immutable objects cannot be changed once created.\n","   Lists (Mutable)\n","   Lists allow adding, removing, or modifying elements.\n","   They are stored as references to memory locations, meaning modifications affect the original object.\n","   Tuples (Immutable)\n","   Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified.\n","   Tuples use fixed memory allocation, making them faster and more memory-efficient.\n","   They are often used when data should remain constant.\n","   Why Is This Important?\n","   Lists are used when data needs to change dynamically.\n","   Tuples are used for fixed, read-only data, ensuring safety and faster performance.\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","   >>Python has two different comparison operators:\n","\n","\n","==\tEquality – Checks if values are the same\ta == b whereas\n","is\tIdentity – Checks if two variables point to the same memory location\ta is b.\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","   >>In Python, logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. They return Boolean values (True or False) based on logical conditions. Python has three logical operators:\n","\n","  - and (Logical AND)\n","  Returns True if both conditions are True, otherwise returns False.\n","\n","  - or (Logical OR)\n","  Returns True if at least one of the conditions is True, otherwise returns False.\n","\n","  - not (Logical NOT)\n","  Reverses the Boolean value.\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n","   >>Type casting, also referred to as type conversion, is the process of changing one data type to another in Python.\n","   Python provides built-in functions for type casting, such as int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), dict(), etc.\n","   Type casting is often necessary for performing arithmetic operations, data manipulation, and input/output operations in Python programs.\n","\n","10.What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","   >>In Python, type casting (or type conversion) is the process of converting one data type into another. There are two types:\n","\n","   - Implicit Type Casting (Automatic Conversion)\n","   Python automatically converts a smaller data type to a larger one without user intervention.\n","   No data loss occurs.\n","   Here, Python implicitly converts int to float to avoid data loss.\n","\n","   - Explicit Type Casting (Manual Conversion)\n","   Done manually using functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n","   May cause data loss if converting between incompatible types.\n","\n","11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","   >>Conditionals in Python are used to execute code based on the evaluation of one or more conditions.\n","   Python supports conditional statements such as if, elif (else if), and else to control the flow of execution.\n","\n","12.How does the elif statement work?\n","   >> The elif statement in Python is short for \"else if\" and is used to test multiple conditions in sequence after an if statement. It allows you to check additional conditions if the previous if or elif conditions were not met. If none of the conditions are True, the else block is executed.\n","\n","   How it works:\n","   - First, the if statement is checked. If it’s True, the block of code inside the if is executed, and the rest of the conditions are ignored.\n","   - Next, if the if statement is False, Python will check the elif (else if) condition. If it’s True, the block of code under the elif is executed.\n","   - Finally, if neither the if nor the elif conditions are True, the else block (if provided) will run.\n","\n","13.What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","   >>The for and while loops in Python are both used for repeated execution of code, but they differ in how they control the iteration.\n","\n","   - for Loop:\n","   Used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).\n","   The number of iterations is determined beforehand, and the loop runs for each item in the sequence.\n","   Commonly used when you know how many times you want to execute the loop.\n","   - while Loop:\n","   Used for repeating a block of code as long as a certain condition is True.\n","   The number of iterations is not predetermined. It continues until the condition evaluates to False.\n","   Commonly used when you don't know how many times you need to iterate but you know the condition under which to stop.\n","\n","14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.?\n","   >>A while loop is more suitable than a for loop in situations where the number of iterations is not known beforehand and is based on a condition that might change dynamically during the execution of the loop.\n","\n","   Scenario Example: User Authentication\n","   Imagine a scenario where you want to repeatedly ask a user for their password until they enter the correct one. You don't know how many attempts it will take, so a while loop is perfect here because it continues asking the user for the password until the correct one is entered.\n","   Why the while loop is suitable here:\n","   The number of iterations is unknown because the user might enter the correct password at any point.\n","   The loop continues based on a condition (whether the user entered the correct password or reached the maximum attempts).\n","   If you used a for loop, you would need a predetermined number of attempts, but this scenario requires flexibility in the number of iterations\n","\n","   \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ZJYhp-sAnh6o"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# PRACTICAL QUESTIONS\n"],"metadata":{"id":"fktaCAr702h9"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1.Write a Python program to print \"Hello, World!\n","print(\"Hello, World!\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"rII-SBvx1A0K","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738569750321,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1920,"user":{"displayName":"Vikas Sehgal","userId":"03708495465943345768"}},"outputId":"3cc3dd2a-0e47-4904-d59d-9f6a423d5490"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, World!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 2.Write a Python program that displays your name and age\n","name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n","age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n","print(\"Name:\", name)\n","print(\"Age:\", age)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"KXgjifYJ1V1G","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738569849390,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":13269,"user":{"displayName":"Vikas Sehgal","userId":"03708495465943345768"}},"outputId":"d74b90b4-05ae-4366-adda-fd65421258dc"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter your name: Vikas Sehgal\n","Enter your age: 24\n","Name: Vikas Sehgal\n","Age: 24\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 3.Write code to print all the pre-defined keywords in Python using the keyword library\n","import keyword\n","print(keyword.kwlist)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"jEQQt6bq11pl","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738571554037,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":851,"user":{"displayName":"Vikas Sehgal","userId":"03708495465943345768"}},"outputId":"6337e168-1f2a-4952-9b8a-dd37f350cca6"},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 4.Write a program that checks if a given word is a Python keyword?\n","import keyword\n","word = input(\"Enter a word: \")\n","if keyword.iskeyword(word):\n","    print(f\"{word} is a Python keyword.\")\n","else:\n","    print(f\"{word} is not a Python keyword.\")\n","\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"5WHlzaYa1rKD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738570082982,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":9387,"user":{"displayName":"Vikas Sehgal","userId":"03708495465943345768"}},"outputId":"c380354c-c489-4bed-a3cc-72454b0fd8e8"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter a word: True\n","True is a Python keyword.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"id":"eGsRbu8YnBW7","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738570314979,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":585,"user":{"displayName":"Vikas Sehgal","userId":"03708495465943345768"}},"outputId":"7755eff6-b3ff-47e7-fa26-153f0c2944ba"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Modified List: [10, 20, 35, 40, 50]\n"]}],"source":["# 5.
